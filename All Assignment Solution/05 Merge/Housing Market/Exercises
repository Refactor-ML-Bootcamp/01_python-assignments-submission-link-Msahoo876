Housing Market
Introduction:
This time we will create our own dataset with fictional numbers to describe a house market. As we are going to create random data don't try to reason of the numbers.

Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
 
Step 2. Create 3 differents Series, each of length 100, as follows:
The first a random number from 1 to 4
The second a random number from 1 to 3
The third a random number from 10,000 to 30,000
 
Step 3. Let's create a DataFrame by joinning the Series by column
 
Step 4. Change the name of the columns to bedrs, bathrs, price_sqr_meter
 
Step 5. Create a one column DataFrame with the values of the 3 Series and assign it to 'bigcolumn'
 
Step 6. Oops, it seems it is going only until index 99. Is it true?
 
Step 7. Reindex the DataFrame so it goes from 0 to 299
