Special thanks to: http://chrisalbon.com/ for sharing the dataset and materials.

Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
 
Step 2. Create the DataFrame with the following values:
raw_data = {'regiment': ['Nighthawks', 'Nighthawks', 'Nighthawks', 'Nighthawks', 'Dragoons', 'Dragoons', 'Dragoons', 'Dragoons', 'Scouts', 'Scouts', 'Scouts', 'Scouts'], 
        'company': ['1st', '1st', '2nd', '2nd', '1st', '1st', '2nd', '2nd','1st', '1st', '2nd', '2nd'], 
        'name': ['Miller', 'Jacobson', 'Ali', 'Milner', 'Cooze', 'Jacon', 'Ryaner', 'Sone', 'Sloan', 'Piger', 'Riani', 'Ali'], 
        'preTestScore': [4, 24, 31, 2, 3, 4, 24, 31, 2, 3, 2, 3],
        'postTestScore': [25, 94, 57, 62, 70, 25, 94, 57, 62, 70, 62, 70]}
Step 3. Assign it to a variable called regiment.
Don't forget to name each column
 
Step 4. What is the mean preTestScore from the regiment Nighthawks?
 
Step 5. Present general statistics by company
 
Step 6. What is the mean of each company's preTestScore?
 
Step 7. Present the mean preTestScores grouped by regiment and company
 
Step 8. Present the mean preTestScores grouped by regiment and company without heirarchical indexing
 
Step 9. Group the entire dataframe by regiment and company
 
Step 10. What is the number of observations in each regiment and company
 
Step 11. Iterate over a group and print the name and the whole data from the regiment
