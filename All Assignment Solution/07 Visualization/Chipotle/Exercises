Visualizing Chipotle's Data
This time we are going to pull data directly from the internet. Special thanks to: https://github.com/justmarkham for sharing the dataset and materials.

Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter

# set this so the graphs open internally
%matplotlib inline
Step 2. Import the dataset from this address.
Step 3. Assign it to a variable called chipo.
 
Step 4. See the first 10 entries
 
Step 5. Create a histogram of the top 5 items bought
 
Step 6. Create a scatterplot with the number of items orderered per order price
Hint: Price should be in the X-axis and Items ordered in the Y-axis
 
Step 7. BONUS: Create a question and a graph to answer your own question.
