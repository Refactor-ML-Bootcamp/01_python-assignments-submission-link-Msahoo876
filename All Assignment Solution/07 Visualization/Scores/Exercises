Scores
Introduction:
This time you will create the data.

*Exercise based on Chris Albon work, the credits belong to him.*

Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
 
Step 2. Create the DataFrame that should look like the one below.
 
first_name	last_name	age	female	preTestScore	postTestScore
0	Jason	Miller	42	0	4	25
1	Molly	Jacobson	52	1	24	94
2	Tina	Ali	36	1	31	57
3	Jake	Milner	24	0	2	62
4	Amy	Cooze	73	1	3	70
Step 3. Create a Scatterplot of preTestScore and postTestScore, with the size of each point determined by age
Hint: Don't forget to place the labels
 
Step 4. Create a Scatterplot of preTestScore and postTestScore.
This time the size should be 4.5 times the postTestScore and the color determined by sex
 
BONUS: Create your own question and answer it.
